The Mentalist is an American police drama/mystery television series that ran from September 23, 2008 until February 18, 2015, broadcasting 151 episodes over seven seasons, on CBS.[2] The show was created by Bruno Heller, who is also its executive producer. The show follows former "psychic" Patrick Jane (Simon Baker), who is a consultant to the California Bureau of Investigation (CBI), using the highly developed observational skills he previously employed to "read" people's minds</p>
<h2>Production and distribution</h2>
<p>
The show often set episodes based on fictional locales with names like Salinger Mill and Rancho Rosa. Like the majority of American television shows, The Mentalist was mostly filmed within the studio zone in Los Angeles County, but occasionally filmed a few scenes on location in Sacramento. The structure used to represent the CBI headquarters in Sacramento is the back of the Pico House in downtown Los Angeles. On October 15, 2008, CBS ordered the first season of The Mentalist[3] and the show has subsequently been renewed annually since 2010 both in the domestic market and overseas.[4][5][6]
TNT began syndicating The Mentalist in the fall of 2011. In the interregnum period between the end of Late Show with David Letterman and Late Show with Stephen Colbert in the summer of 2015, The Mentalist was carried weeknights on CBS in full as part of the network's temporary late night lineup.
In November 2013, it was confirmed that Amanda Righetti (Van Pelt) and Owain Yeoman (Rigsby) would be leaving after season six concluded.
In the season 7 episode "Orange Blossom Ice Cream", scenes set in Beirut were filmed in Los Angeles and supplemented by freelance footage of Beirut by Michael Timney.
On May 10, 2014, CBS renewed the series for a 13-episode seventh season which premiered on November 30, 2014 and later announced it as the final season.

<p>The Emoji Movie is a 2017 American 3D computer-animated science fiction-comedy film directed by Tony Leondis and written by Leondis, Eric Siegel and Mike White, based on the trend of emojis. It stars the voices of T. J. Miller, James Corden, Anna Faris, Maya Rudolph, Steven Wright, Rob Riggle, Jennifer Coolidge, Christina Aguilera, Sofía Vergara, Sean Hayes and Patrick Stewart. The film centers on Gene, a multi-expressional emoji who lives in a teenager's phone, and who sets out on a journey to become a normal meh emoji like his parents.
Produced by Sony Pictures Animation, and distributed by Columbia Pictures, The Emoji Movie premiered on July 23, 2017 at the Regency Village Theatre and was theatrically released in the United States on July 28, 2017. It grossed over $215 million worldwide but was panned by critics.</p>
<h3>Box office</h3>
<p>As of November 5, 2017, The Emoji Movie has grossed $85.8 million in the United States and Canada and $128.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $214.2 million, against a production budget of $50 million.
The Emoji Movie was released alongside Atomic Blonde, and was projected to gross around $20 million from 4,075 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $900,000 from Thursday night previews and $10.1 million on its first day. It went on to debut to $24.5 million, finishing second at the box office behind Dunkirk.
Review embargoes for the film were lifted midday July 27, only a few hours before the film premiered to the general public, in a move considered among one of several tactics studios are using to try to curb bad Rotten Tomatoes ratings. Speaking of the effect embargoing reviews until last minute had on the film's debut, Josh Greenstein, Sony Pictures president of worldwide marketing and distribution, said, "The Emoji Movie was built for people under 18 ... so we wanted to give the movie its best chance. What other wide release with a score under 8 percent has opened north of $20 million? I don't think there is one."[41] In the film's second weekend it dropped nearly 50%, grossing $12.4 million and finishing in 3rd.</p>
